# Tropical Geometry Projects

A collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring concepts in tropical algebra and geometryâ€”especially in the min-plus and max-plus semirings.

## What's Inside

- `Tropical_Algebra.ipynb`: Experiments and visualizations using R and Python to explore tropical geometry topics like tropical polytopes, hypersurfaces, and convexity in the min-plus world.

## Goals

This is a learning-through-doing notebook. I'm using this repo to:
- Get more comfortable visualizing tropical objects.
- Explore differences between min-plus and max-plus algebra.
- Practice with concrete examples from sources like Sturmfels and Maclagan.

## How to View

To run the notebook:
1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/jay10440/tropical.geometry.git
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any notebook viewer: jupyter notebook Tropical_Algebra.ipynb

## Notes

This is an evolving project, mostly exploratory. Some sections are rough drafts. I'm happy to clean it up or expand if there's interest.
